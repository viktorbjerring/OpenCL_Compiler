# psychic-system

This repository is covering the research and development project made with Aarhus University, and is an experiment into using OpenCL to use hardware acceleration for compilation. 

This repository is testing implementations in OpenCL, once with a usual use case for hardware acceleration - in this case drawing Mandlebrot fractals, and once with one segment of a compiler - the lexer.

To compile for a local system, after configuring OpenCL for the desired platform, create using cmake within the folders.
